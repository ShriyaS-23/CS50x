Consists of two pages 'Today' and 'Choose Date'

##### Today:
Displays events, deaths and births that have happened in history today. All of the informaton is displayed in independentaly scrollable sections to prevent the page from being too long. Information is displayed in a card deck layout with each piece of information on a different card.

##### Choose Date:
Displays events, deaths and births that have happened on any custom date of the user's choosing in history. Layout is similar to the 'Today' page with independently scrollable sections for events, deaths and births and a card deck layout to display the information.

Error checking has been done by putting in checks to prevent the user from putting in invalid dates that won't fetch any data.
